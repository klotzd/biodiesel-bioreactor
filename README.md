# Advanced Process Optimisation 2 - Project Code

Simulation of a microalgae based fatty acid methyl ester (FAME, aka biodiesel) reactor. Reactor dynamics are described by a system of ODEs, with parameter estimation routines being applied to experimental data. Additionally contains modules to conduct various types of sensitiviy analysis and multi-objective process optimisation.

Requires ```Julia 1.5+``` and the packages ```YAML, Distributions, Random, DifferentialEquations, Sundials, DataFrames, DiffEqSensitivity, Statistics, QuasiMonteCarlo```.
